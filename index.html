                        I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun!" I enrolled shortly thereafter.
                        The next 12 weeks was the best - and most gruelling -time of my life.Since completing the course,

                <div id="second-testimony">"Before joining the bootcamp,I've never written a line of code.
                    I needed some structures from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step.
                    I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
                    The entire curriculum and staffs did not disappoint.They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.
                    The agile team project,in particular,was outstanding.It took my learning to the next level in a way that
                    no tutorial could ever have.In fact,I have often referred to it during my interviews as an example of my development
                    experience.It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.100% recommend! "
